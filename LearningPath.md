Hello! This is where I will document my progress for this project:

Languages: HTML/CSS, JS
Tools: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Git, Miro

I initially finished the frontend with user input validation but wanted to do more since I wanted to be able to use this app personally. A little background
of how and why I am doing this project is because my friends and I have a hard time splitting expenses when we go on trips together. For instance, one pays for the 
AirBnb, the other for food, and some for activities and many other things. I want to solve this problem of confusion and frustration and also I really think this project is scalable and can be used by many other people. There is so much features I wanted to create but for now, let's keep that as a secret! One step at a time.

Progress:
1. Finished the key component of the app with utilizing only JS, HTML, and CSS.
2. Connecting the backend
3. Connecting MongoDB to store accounts, logs, activities
