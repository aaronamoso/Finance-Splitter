What I learn...

In the context of the Document Object Model (DOM), a **node** is any object in the DOM tree that represents part of an HTML or XML document. Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the document is a node, making up a structured tree of nodes that represents the document's structure. 

### Types of Nodes in the DOM

1. **Element Nodes**:
   - Represent HTML or XML elements, like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<input>`, etc.
   - These nodes can have child nodes (elements nested inside other elements).

2. **Text Nodes**:
   - Represent the actual text within an element.
   - For example, if you have `<p>Hello, world!</p>`, the "Hello, world!" part is a text node inside the `<p>` element node.

3. **Attribute Nodes**:
   - Represent attributes of elements, like `id`, `class`, or `style`.
   - Attributes are considered separate nodes even though they belong to their respective elements.

4. **Comment Nodes**:
   - Represent comments within the HTML, such as `<!-- This is a comment -->`.
   - These nodes are usually ignored in terms of rendering but are still part of the DOM structure.

5. **Document Node**:
   - The top-level node that represents the entire HTML or XML document itself.
   - All other nodes are children of this node.

### Example

Consider the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="container">
      <p>Hello, <span>world</span>!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The DOM structure for this document would look something like this:

- **Document Node**
  - **Element Node**: `<html>`
    - **Element Node**: `<body>`
      - **Element Node**: `<div id="container">`
        - **Element Node**: `<p>`
          - **Text Node**: "Hello, "
          - **Element Node**: `<span>`
            - **Text Node**: "world"
          - **Text Node**: "!"

Each item in this hierarchy is a **node**.

### Working with Nodes

In JavaScript, you can access and manipulate these nodes using DOM methods like:
- `document.getElementById("id")`: Retrieves an element node by its ID.
- `element.appendChild(node)`: Adds a child node to an existing element.
- `node.removeChild(node)`: Removes a child node from an element.
- `document.createElement("tag")`: Creates a new element node (not yet part of the DOM until it’s appended somewhere).

Nodes are the building blocks of a web document in the DOM, which allows JavaScript to interact with the content and structure of a web page.








To use **Express** in a Node.js environment, follow these steps to set up and run your project:

### Step 1: Initialize a Node.js Project
1. **Open your terminal** (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or your code editor’s integrated terminal).
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to create your project. You can use the `cd` command to change the directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Run `npm init` or `npm init -y` to generate a `package.json` file (the `-y` flag automatically accepts the default values).
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
   This will create a basic `package.json` file.

### Step 2: Install Express
1. Install **Express** using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```
   This will add **Express** as a dependency and create a `node_modules` folder along with an updated `package.json` file.

### Step 3: Create a Simple Express App
1. Create a new file for your server, typically `app.js` or `index.js`:
   ```bash
   touch app.js
   ```
   Or create the file manually through your code editor.
   
2. Open `app.js` and write a basic Express server setup:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Define a route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   // Set the port for the server to listen on
   const port = 3000;
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Server
1. In your terminal, make sure you're in the project folder (where `app.js` is located).
2. Run the server with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
3. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like this:
   ```
   Server running at http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Step 5: Test the Server
1. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. You should see the message **"Hello, World!"** displayed.

### Optional: Use Nodemon for Auto-Restart (Development)
If you’re actively developing and want the server to automatically restart when you change code, you can install **Nodemon** globally:
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
Then run your app with `nodemon` instead of `node`:
```bash
nodemon app.js
```

This will keep the server running and restart it automatically when you make changes to the code.
